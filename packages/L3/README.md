L3 is the highest level of the language. The program is one expression body that essentially acts like a tree with sub expressions. (In class, there was some acronym for the type of tree that I forgot)

## Relevant Characteristics
- LetRec & Let: local binding values/terms to a name, where LetRec enables recursive and mutually recursive definitions
- Reference, Abstract, Apply: variable lookup, lambda function creation, and function application over some term(s)
- Immediate: integer literals, ready to be used.
- Primitive: arithmetic over terms using plus, minus, and multiply.
- Branch: expression-level conditional selection using comparisons, like a ternary expression.
- Allocate, Load, Store: making a block of memory, reading that block of memory, writing something into the block
- Begin: starts a sequence of evaluations and returns final value
